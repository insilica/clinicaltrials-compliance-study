	abstract = {Federal law requires that the results of many clinical trials be publicly reported at {ClinicalTrials}.gov in a timely manner. A review of clinical trials revealed generally poor compliance with the law, although industry-funded trials fared better than others. The human experimentation that is conducted in clinical trials creates ethical obligations to make research findings publicly available. However, there are numerous historical examples of potentially harmful data being withheld from public scrutiny and selective publication of trial results.1–3 In 2000, Congress authorized the creation of the {ClinicalTrials}.gov registry to provide information about and access to clinical trials for persons with serious medical conditions. In 2007, Section 801 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act ({FDAAA}) expanded this mandate by requiring sponsors of applicable clinical trials to register and report basic summary results at {ClinicalTrials}.gov.4 Such trials generally . . .},

It aims to increase accountability in the clinical research enterprise, making key information available to researchers, funders, and the public. Title {VIII} of the Food and Drug Administration ({FDA}) Amendments Act of 2007 ({FDAAA}) expanded the legal mandate for sponsors and others responsible for certain clinical trials of {FDA}-regulated drug, biologic, and device products to register their studies and report summary results information to {ClinicalTrials}.gov,1 which is managed by the National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health ({NIH}). The statute expanded registration requirements and provided a legally defined timeline with specific requirements for the systematic reporting of summary trial results.
